### What I learned

I learned how to efficiently use HTML, CSS, I could not figure out how to us CSS Flexbox and Grid. Will be grateful for any free online courses for the same.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I want to master CSS elements like Grid and Flexbox. I also want to learn JavaScript to make more dynamic webpages and add more functionality in them.

Would be grateful for any suggestions regarding the same.
